I got into it during numerous individual and university projects. In each of them I showed creativity, consistency and attention to the quality of the application and code. During my studies, I also had the opportunity to participate in practices and programming internships. During them I learned how to work in the SCRUM system, how to communicate with client while receiving an application creation order and how to program with modern standards."
